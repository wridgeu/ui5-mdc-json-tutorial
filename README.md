# Metadata-Driven Controls #UI5

Nothing but doing the tutorial and having a look at some capabilities as I wasn't able to participate in the workshop at UI5Con24 and have not yet had the fun to actively work with MDC at all.

Check out the [MDC Tutorial](https://github.com/SAP-samples/ui5-mdc-json-tutoria) you may also want to check out the [mdc lib](https://github.com/SAP/openui5/tree/fea16382a4a2a650743a407ea8a7404a13d8fd54/src/sap.ui.mdc) in the source.
